From the official [DiffusionNet repository](https://github.com/nmwsharp/diffusion-net):

"**DiffusionNet** is a general-purpose method for deep learning on surfaces such as 3D triangle meshes and point clouds. It is well-suited for tasks like segmentation, classification, feature extraction, etc."

The model is described in detail in [Sharp et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00888).
